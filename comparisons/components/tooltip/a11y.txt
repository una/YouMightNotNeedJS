Usage: The tooltip trigger must have the aria-describedby attribute, and its value must be a unique id which is given to its associated tooltip. The tooltip itself must have role="tooltip". The tooltip trigger must receive focus by the keyboard, and must trigger the tooltip on hover and focus. The tooltip itself should not recieve focus. It meets most of the guidelines set by the W3C ARIA Authoring Practices. What is missing is the tooltip being dismissed by the Esc key and the trigger on hover being announced by the screenreader.
